	<i>Penalty yardage: Offense moves forward five yards.</i>
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Offside</b><br/>
	Penalty description: This foul is almost always committed by the defense. It happens when a player is on the wrong side of the line of scrimmage when the ball is snapped. The play is not stopped for an offside penalty and the foul is announced by the official at the end of the play. This gives the offense what many people call a free play. The offense can make a play and potentially gain yards, declining the penalty. If the play works against the offense (no yards gained or a turnover), the offense can accept the penalty and keep possession of the ball.
	<i>Penalty yardage: Offense moves up five yards if committed by the defense.</i>
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Pass interference</b><br/>
	Penalty description: There is both offensive and defensive pass interference. It happens when a player makes physical contact with an intended receiver after the ball has been thrown and before another player has touched it in order to prevent that receiver from making the catch. On offense, it happens when receiver makes contact with a defender to hinder the defender's ability to play pass defense. 
	<i>Penalty yardage: If it is offensive pass interference, the offense moves back 10 yards. If it is defensive pass interference, the offense gets the ball at the spot of the foul (or on the one yard line if the foul happened in the end zone) and an automatic first down.</i>
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Personal foul</b><br/>
	Penalty description: A conduct related or safety related foul. Includes things like targeting, unnecessary roughness, late hit and hitting a player who’s out of bounds. Officials can eject players from the game for excessive fouls.
	<i>Penalty yardage: If offense commits the foul, offense moves back 15 yards. If defense commits the foul, offense moves up 15 yards and gets an automatic first down regardless of how many yards were gained on the play.</i>
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Roughing the passer</b><br/>
	Penalty description: When a defender continues an effort to tackle or hit the quarterback after the quarterback has already thrown the ball. For the officials to call roughing the passer, the hit has to be deliberate and delayed. 
	<i>Penalty yardage: Offense moves up 15 yards and gets an automatic first down regardless of how many yards they gained on the play.</i>
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Running into the kicker and roughing the kicker</b><br/>
	Penalty description: Running into the kicker happens when a defender fails to block a kick and runs into the kicker. Running into the kicker is not intentional. Roughing the kicker is different. Roughing the kicker is a when the defender more deliberately runs into the kicker in a way that may injure the kicker. It is considered a personal foul.
	<i>Penalty yardage: Running into the kicker is a five-yard penalty. Roughing the kicker gives the kicking team an automatic first down and 15 yards.</i>
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Tripping</b><br/>
	Penalty description: One of the least confusing penalties a player can commit. A player trips another player.
	<i>Penalty yardage: If offense commits the penalty, move back 10 yards. If defense commits penalty, offense moves up 10 yards and gets an automatic first down.</i>
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Unsportsmanlike conduct</b><br/>
	Penalty description: The biggest thing to understand about unsportsmanlike conduct is it is a non-contact foul, if contact is made, it would be called a personal foul. Unsportsmanlike conduct includes anything where a player acts or speaks in a way that is intentionally harmful, throwing the ball away after a play is over because the player is angry, taunting, excessive celebration and verbal abuse of officials. Officials can eject a player from a game for excessive unsportsmanlike conduct. 
	<i>Penalty yardage: If offense commits the foul, move back 15 yards. If defense commits the foul, offense moves up 15 yards and gets an automatic first down regardless of how many yards the offense gained on the play.</i>
