    <h1>Player Positions</h1>

    <!-- This is a list of the player positions -->
    <!-- This section contains content on offensive positions -->
	<p>
	<b class = "big">Offense: The offense is the team who has the ball and is trying to score. There are several different players that make up the offense, let’s take a closer look at them.
	</b><br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Quarterback (QB):</b><br/> The quarterback is the man in charge. He is the most important player on offense, and quite possibly the most important player on the entire team. His job is to work with the coaches to figure out the play and communicate with the rest of the offense what the plan is in the huddle or at the line of scrimmage. He receives the ball from the center and either throws the ball, hands the ball to another player who will run, or keep the ball and run himself.
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Wide receivers (WR):</b><br/> Wide receivers are pass-catching specialists, meaning they are one of the main players to catch a throw from the quarterback. The wide receivers are usually the fastest receivers. They can line up at different spots for the play, but their main job is to run different routes, catch a pass and continue to run after the catch if possible.
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Running back (RB):</b><br/> Running backs are the guys who typically execute rushing plays. The tailback or halfback is a type of running back who is most often the primary person carrying the ball on a rushing play. He’s like the handyman on offense; he can run the ball, block or catch the ball if no receivers are open. A fullback is another type of running back. He’s usually a larger and stronger guy than the other running backs, and is powerful runner. Fullbacks are used for blocking and catching, in addition to running.
	<br/><br/>  

	<b class = "big">Tight end (TE):</b><br/> Tight ends are receivers. They are typically bigger and stronger than other receivers. They line up on either side of and next to the tackles. They’re sort of a hybrid player. Because they line up next to the tackle, they frequently block, but they also act as receivers.
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Center (C):</b><br/> This player begins the play by snapping the ball to the quarterback and is part of the offensive line. He lines up in the middle of the offensive line. After snapping the ball, his job is to block defensive players.
	Offensive guard (G): Two guards line up on each side of the center as part of the offensive line. Pretty much their only job is to block defenders on both running and passing plays. These are pretty big guys usually.
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Offensive tackle (T):</b><br/> Two tackles line up outside of the two guards as part of the line offensive line. Similar to the guards, the tackles primary job is to block defenders on running and passing plays. For right-handed quarterbacks, the left tackle is in charge of protecting the quarterback from getting hit from behind, protecting his blind side.

    <!-- This section contains content on defensive positions -->
    <p>
    <b class = "big">Defense: The defense is the team that does not have possession of the ball. The defense’s job is to prevent the offense from scoring. There are several different players that make up the defense, let’s take a closer look at them.
    </b><br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Defensive tackle (DT):</b><br/> These players are part of the defensive line, meaning they line up directly on the line of scrimmage. They are some of the largest players of defense because their job is to rush towards the quarterback and stop running plays.
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Defensive end (DE):</b><br/> The two defensive ends line up next to the defensive tackles, at the edges of the defensive line. Their main job is to rush toward the quarterback in an attempt to sack him and stop running plays. The faster of the two ends lines up on the right side of the defensive line, because that is the quarterback’s blind side.
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Linebackers (LB):</b><br/> Linebackers play behind the defensive line and do a lot of different things including rushing the passer, covering receivers and defending runs. One type of linebacker is the middle linebacker. Middle linebackers have to be able to stop running backs who make it past the defensive line, covering pass plays and rushing the quarterback. The outside linebackers are given different names depending on their role. Some line up against the tight end and defend on running or pass plays. Other outside linebackers rush the quarterback and cover a running back on pass plays.
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Cornerback (CB):</b><br/> A cornerback is a type of defensive back, which is also known as the secondary. Cornerbacks typically cover the wide receivers. They try to prevent quarterback passes by batting the pass down away from the receiver or catching the ball themselves. On running plays, their job is to contain the runner by tackling or forcing him out of bounds.
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Safety (S):</b><br/> Safeties are also a type of defensive back, which is also known as the secondary. These guys are the last line of defense and typically help the corners with pass coverage.
	<br/><br/>

    <!-- This sections contains content on special positions -->
    <p>
    <b class = "big">Special teams: Special teams are the unit of players on field for kicking plays. Many offensive and defensive players play similar roles on special teams, such as offensive linemen to block and defensive players to tackle, but there are some players unique to special teams. Let’s take a look at these players.
    </b><br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Kicker (K):</b><br/> The kicker is pretty straightforward. He handles kickoffs, extra points and field goal attempts.
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Holder (H):</b><br/> This player holds the ball for the kicker. Most of the time, a backup quarterback or punter is used as the holder instead of a separate player.
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Long snapper (LS):</b><br/> This is a type of center who specializes in snapping the ball directly to the holder or punter. They usually have to snap the ball much farther on a kicking play than on a regular offensive play, so it is usually a different player than the center.
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Punter (P):</b><br/> The punter receives the ball after a snap, drops the ball and kicks it into the air, as far down the field as possible. This is usually only done on fourth down to relinquish possession to the defensive team.
	<br/><br/>

	<b class = "big">Kick returner (KR) and punt returner (PR):</b><br/> Teams typically use running backs, wide receivers or defensive backs as the returners, or the fastest player on a team. They are responsible for catching kicked balls and running the ball back as far down the field as possible.
